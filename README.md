# Where-In-The-World
Android phone Google Maps based guessing game with interactive hint system.

This is a full game with multiple activities, an sqlite database, token based payment system and progressive gameplay mechanics.  It is similar to [Geoguesser](https://geoguessr.com/), but has an interactive hint system developed for touch screens and includes unlockable categories and levels with randomly selected locations.  It was developed by Jason Christie (artist) and myself over a 9 month period in 2014.  It was developed in Eclipse.
