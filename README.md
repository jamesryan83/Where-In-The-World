# Where-In-The-World
Android phone Google Maps based guessing game with interactive hint system.

This is the full source code for the game Where in the World.  It contains an sqlite database, token based payment system and progressive gameplay mechanics.  It is similar to [Geoguesser](https://geoguessr.com/), but has an interactive hint system developed for touch screens and includes unlockable categories and levels with randomly selected locations.  It was developed by Jason Christie (artist) and myself over a 9 month period in 2014.  

Libraries used were [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) and [sqlite-asset-helper](https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-sqlite-asset-helper)

The code probably won't run without providing your own api keys.  The api keys have been replaced by 'NOT TELLING' in the code.  The actual game code is in src/com/dreamfire/whereintheworld
